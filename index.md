## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "/assets/images/profile_pic.png" | relative_url }}){: style="width:250px; height:auto;" class="profile-image"}

 
My name is Julie, and I'm a sophomore undergraduate student at Cornell University, majoring in mechanical engineering! I love working on hands-on projects; I'm hoping to gain more experience with 3D modeling complex structures as well as applying my academic knowledge to real-life projects.

In my free time, I enjoy discovering new music, working out, and watching movies. I'm hoping to learn archery soon!
