For my final project in MAE 3260, I worked in a team of 4 to investigate the effects of a feedforward control system on an N-story building that is subjected to external forces such as earthquake movement. We researched the dynamics of both an uncontrolled building and a controlled building that has a feedback-feedforward control system implemented. Using past earthquake data, we simulated the effects of it on a 10-story building that has feedforward control. I specifically researched the effects of an earthquake on a feedback-feedfoward controlled N-story building by reading research papers, creating the state space form, and drawing the block diagram.
