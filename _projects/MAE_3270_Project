For my materials class at Cornell, my final project was to design a non-ratcheting ⅜ drive torque wrench. The goal was to maximize the voltage output of the wrench (mV/V) at the rated torque. The wrench must sustain a fully reversed torque of T = 600 in-lbf for 10^6 cycles. The following design requirements had to be met:
Attain at least 1.0 mV/V output at the rated torque of 600 in-lbf
Safety factor of X_o = 4 for yield or brittle failure
Safety factor of X_k = 2 for crack growth from an assumed crack of depth of 0.04 inches (1 mm) 
Fatigue stress safety factor of X_s = 1.5
Material must be a steel, aluminum, or titanium alloy

Images of the CAD model are shown below. The key dimensions of my design are L = 20 inches, h = 0.6 inches, b = 0.25 inches, and c = 1.


The material that I used was AISI 4340. Here are the relevant mechanical properties that I used for my analysis:
Young’s Modulus: 29 x 10^6 psi
Poisson’s ratio: 0.32
Yield strength: 217 ksi
Fracture toughness: 75 ksi*in^1/2
Fatigue strength: 90 ksi

Maximum normal stress is around 64151 psi. However, on the handle according to the beam theory, it is around 39130 psi.

Load Point Deflection around 0.67334 inches

Strain at the strain gauge locations is around 1310.3 microstrain.

Torque wrench sensitivity: 1.3101 mV/V
Output goal is met! Now let's calculate the safety factors for yield, crack, and fatigue stress. I will be using the stress value on the handle according to beam theory, which is around 39130 psi.
Yield safety factor is around 5.546 > 4
Crack safety factor is around 4.723 > 2
Fatigue stress safety factor is around 2.300 > 1.5
Safety factor requirements are met!!

Strain gauge selected:
SGD-3/350-LY13 from DWYEROMEGA. More information about the strain gauge is linked here: https://assets.dwyeromega.com/pdf/test-and-measurement-equipment/strain-gauges/SGD_LINEAR1-AXIS.pdf
Dimensions are 0.157 in x 0.276 in, which would fit on the handle!
