For my fluid mechanics class at Cornell, my group's final project was dissecting a lawn mower engine, primarily talking about the carburator. I specifically worked on using an impact driver to unscrew the engine and used a plier and mallet to take off the flywheel. I measured various important components of the carburator, which includes the diameter and length. In our video below, I worked on giving an overview of how a 4-stroke engine works and described the various important parts of our engine such as the flywheel and rocker arms. This was a great hands-on experience with working with power tools, and I was excited to see how the content I learned from my class, such as the Bernoulli's equation, are important in an everyday object.
