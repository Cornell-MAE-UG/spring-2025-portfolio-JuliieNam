For Introduction to Mechanical Design, my team and I designed a multifunctional keychain case that would function as a screwdriver and a tape measure. This was meant to people who prefer a compact, functional tools to help simplify everyday tasks.

We utilized Fusion 360 to model our case and 3D printed most of our parts using PLA. This helped me learn a lot as a first-time user of Fusion 360 and 3D printing, this projected helped me learn basic design principles. I was able to learn a lot of CAD skills as well as learning more about tolerances and quality of 3D printing.
